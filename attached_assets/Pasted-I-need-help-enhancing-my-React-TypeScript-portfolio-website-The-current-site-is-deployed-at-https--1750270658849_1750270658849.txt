I need help enhancing my React-TypeScript portfolio website. The current site is deployed at https://portfolio-website-nu-one-76.vercel.app/ and the code is at https://github.com/Animeshkbiswas/Portfolio-website.

CURRENT TECH STACK:
- React.js with TypeScript
- Vite as build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components
- Deployed on Vercel

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

1. VISUAL DESIGN & LAYOUT:
- Add a professional headshot/profile photo in the hero section
- Improve visual hierarchy with better spacing and typography
- Enhance color scheme with modern gradients and consistent theming
- Add subtle animations and micro-interactions
- Improve the hero section with more engaging visual elements

2. MISSING ESSENTIAL FEATURES:
- Add a dark/light theme toggle with smooth transitions
- Implement project case study modals with detailed information, screenshots, and technology stacks
- Add a testimonials section with client/colleague feedback
- Create a downloadable resume button
- Add social proof elements (GitHub stats, certifications, achievements)

3. CONTENT ENHANCEMENTS:
- Reorganize projects with better visual cards, hover effects, and detailed descriptions
- Add project screenshots/mockups for visual appeal
- Include metrics and results for each project (performance improvements, accuracy rates, etc.)
- Add a blog/articles section for thought leadership
- Enhance the about section with a more compelling narrative

4. TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Implement smooth scroll navigation between sections
- Add loading animations and skeleton screens
- Optimize images with proper alt text for accessibility
- Add SEO meta tags and Open Graph data
- Implement lazy loading for better performance

5. INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
- Create an interactive skills visualization (progress bars, skill trees, or animated charts)
- Add hover effects and transitions throughout the site
- Implement a working contact form with validation and email integration
- Add a "View Live Demo" and "View Code" buttons for each project
- Include interactive elements in the hero section (typing animation, particle effects)

6. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS:
- Ensure perfect mobile layout and navigation
- Add mobile-friendly hamburger menu
- Optimize touch interactions and button sizes
- Test and fix any mobile-specific issues

7. ACCESSIBILITY & UX:
- Add proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Add focus indicators for all interactive elements

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep the existing content but reorganize and enhance it
- Maintain the professional tone while making it more engaging
- Use modern web design trends (glassmorphism, neumorphism, gradient overlays)
- Ensure fast loading times and smooth animations
- Add call-to-action buttons strategically throughout the site

DESIGN INSPIRATION:
Create a modern, clean, and professional portfolio that stands out to recruiters and clients. Think Apple-like design aesthetics with subtle animations and excellent user experience.

Please implement these changes while maintaining the existing React-TypeScript-Tailwind structure and ensuring the site remains fast and accessible.
